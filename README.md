# chat_app : SLT application

The purpose of this project is to facilitate effective and inclusive communication in multilingual meetings by developing a robust software/tool that translates speech in real time. This tool will bridge the gap between participants who speak different languages, enabling them to fully understand and engage in discussions without the need for external interpreters.
